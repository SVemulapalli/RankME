<h1><strong>TASK: Rate the quality of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to rate the quality of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>You will see the Meaning Representation and automatically generated utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the system should convey.</p>

<p>In this task, your task is to rate each utterance for its (1) informativeness, &nbsp;(2) naturalness, and (3) quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1)<strong><em>&nbsp;Informativeness</em></strong> is defined as whether the utterance provides all the information given in the meaning representation and does not give any unnecessary information.</p>

<p>(2) <strong><strong><em>Naturalness&nbsp;</em></strong></strong>is defined as whether you think the utterance could have been produced by a native speaker.</p>

<p>(3)<strong><em>&nbsp;Quality</em></strong> is defined as an overall quality of the utterance, in terms of its grammatical correctness, fluency and other important factors.</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>

<h2><u>Example 1</u></h2>

<p><strong>This is a given Meaning Representation:</strong>
	<br>name[The Eagle], area[city centre]</p>

<p><strong>This is a given utterance that needs to be evaluated:</strong>
	<br>The Eagle is a Chinese restaurant located in the city centre.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:
	<br>This utterance should be scored as of a low informativeness (it contains the information that is not provided in the meaning representation - "Chinese restaurant"), but highly natural (it could have been produced by a native speaker), and of a high quality (the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent).</p>

<h2><u>Example 2</u></h2>

<p><strong>This is a given Meaning Representation:</strong>
	<br>name[The Eagle], area[city centre], pricerange[cheap]</p>

<p><strong>This is a given utterance that needs to be evaluated:</strong>
	<br>The Eagle are located in the city centre. It is cheap.</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:
	<br>This utterance should be scored as highly informative (it contains all the information provided in the meaning representation), but not very natural (a native speaker would not produce it) and of a low quality (the sentence is not grammatically correct).</p>

<h2><u>Example 3</u></h2>

<p><strong>This is a given Meaning Representation:</strong>
	<br>name[The Eagle], area[city centre], near[Alimentum]</p>

<p><strong>This is a given utterance that needs to be evaluated:</strong>
	<br>The Eagle is located near Alimentum.</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:
	<br>This utterance should be scored as of a low informativeness (it does not contain all the information provided in the meaning representation, the concept area[city centre] is missed), but of a high quality (the sentence is grammatically correct and fluent) and high naturalness (it could have been produced by a native speaker).</p>
