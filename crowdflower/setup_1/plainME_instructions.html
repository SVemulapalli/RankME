<h1><strong>TASK: Rate the quality of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the quality of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>In this task, your task is to evaluate each utterance for its (1) informativeness, &nbsp;(2) naturalness, and (3) quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1)<strong><em>&nbsp;Informativeness</em></strong> is defined as whether the utterance provides all the information given in the meaning representation.</p>

<p>(2) <strong><em>Naturalness&nbsp;</em></strong>is defined as whether you think the utterance could have been produced by a native speaker.</p>

<p>(3)<strong><em>&nbsp;Quality</em></strong> is defined as an overall quality of the utterance, in terms of its grammatical correctness, fluency and other important factors.</p>

<p>Before each task, you will see the STANDARD you need to relate your scores to. &nbsp;You will see the Meaning Representation and automatically generated Utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the utterance should convey. The Informativeness, Naturalness and Quality scores for the STANDARD are provided.</p>

<p>Your task is to evaluate the utterance shown after the sentence "Here is the TASK for you" for its Informativeness, Naturalness and Quality. You may use any whole positive numbers that seem appropriate to you. However, you <strong>may not use negative numbers, zero, fractions or decimals</strong>. Do not worry about running out of numbersâ€”there will always be a larger number than the largest you use (use max 6 digits), and there are a lot of smaller numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please evaluate each utterance in relation to the standard one.</strong> For example, if the current utterance seems half as informative as the standard one, then assign an informativeness score that is half of the standard informativeness score. If the current utterance seems to be a bit more natural than the standard one, then assign a naturalness score that is a bit higher than the standard naturalness score.</p>

	</tbody>
</table>

<p>
	<br>The utterance you should evaluate does not contain all the information provided in the meaning representation, the concept area[city centre] is missed. Due to this, Informativeness score must be lower than 100 (lower than the Informativeness score for the standard utterance). However, this utterance is as grammatically correct and fluent as the standard, thus Naturalness and Quality scores are both 100 (same as Naturalness and Quality scores for the standard utterance).</p>
