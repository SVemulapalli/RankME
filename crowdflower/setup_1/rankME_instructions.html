<h1><strong>TASK: Rate the quality of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the quality of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>In this task, your task is to evaluate each utterance for its (1) informativeness, &nbsp;(2) naturalness, and (3) quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1)<strong><em>&nbsp;Informativeness</em></strong> is defined as whether the utterance provides all the information given in the meaning representation.</p>

<p>(2) <strong><em>Naturalness&nbsp;</em></strong>is defined as whether you think the utterance could have been produced by a native speaker.</p>

<p>(3)<strong><em>&nbsp;Quality</em></strong> is defined as an overall quality of the utterance, in terms of its grammatical correctness, fluency and other important factors.</p>

<p>Before each task, you will see the STANDARD you need to relate your scores to. &nbsp;You will see the Meaning Representation and automatically generated Utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the utterance should convey. The Informativeness, Naturalness and Quality scores for the STANDARD are provided.</p>

<p>After the sentence "Here is the TASK for you", you will see a Meaning Representation and three potentially different utterances expressing this same meaning. Your task is to <strong>evaluate and rank</strong> the utterances shown after the sentence "Here is the TASK for you" for their Informativeness, Naturalness and Quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may use any whole positive numbers that seem appropriate to you as a score. However, you <strong>may not use negative numbers, zero, fractions or decimals</strong>. Do not worry about running out of numbersâ€”there will always be a larger number than the largest you use (use max 6 digits), and there are a lot of smaller numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please evaluate each utterance both in relation to the standard one and in relation to each other.</strong> For example, if the first utterance seems half as informative as the standard one but twice more informative than the second given utterance, then assign an informativeness score for the first utterance that is half of the standard informativeness score. The informativeness score for the second utterance, at the same time, should be twice smaller than the score for the first utterance. If all the given utterances seem to be a bit more natural than the standard one, then assign the same naturalness scores to all three utterances and make it a bit higher than the standard naturalness score.</p>

<p>
	<br><em>Explanation</em>: The first utterance you should evaluate does not contain all the information provided in the meaning representation, the concept area[city centre] is missed. The other two utterances contain all the information from the meaning representation. Due to this, Informativeness score for the first one must be lower than 100 (lower than the Informativeness score for the standard utterance and lower than the scores for the other two utterances). The third utterance sounds a bit less natural than the first two or the standard, thus its Naturalness score is a bit lower. The second utterance has a grammatical error (<em>its</em> instead of <em>it's</em>), this is why its Quality score is lower comparing to the standard and other utterances.</p>
