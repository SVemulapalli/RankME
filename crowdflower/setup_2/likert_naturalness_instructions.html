<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>In this task, you need to rate each utterance for its naturalness on a scale from "very unnatural" to "very natural".</p>

<p><strong><strong><em>Naturalness&nbsp;</em></strong></strong>is defined as whether you think the utterance could have been produced by a native speaker.</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>

	<br>Aromi is located in the city centre. It is not family-friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:

<h2><u>Example 2</u></h2>
