<h1><strong>TASK: Evaluate the quality of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the quality of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>You will see the Meaning Representation and automatically generated utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the system should convey.</p>

<p>In this task, you need to (1) tick the check-boxes that apply to a given utterance, &nbsp;(2) rate the utterance for its quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Quality</em></strong> is defined as an overall quality of the utterance, in terms of its grammatical correctness, fluency and other important factors.</p>

<h1>Examples</h1>

<h2><u>Example 1</u></h2>

<p><strong>This is a given Meaning Representation:</strong>
	<br>name[The Eagle], area[city centre]</p>

<p><strong>This is a given utterance that needs to be evaluated:</strong>
	<br>The Eagle is a Chinese restaurant located in the city centre.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:</p>

<p>The first check-box should be ticked because the utterance contains the information that is not provided in the meaning representation - "Chinese restaurant":</p>

<p>☑ The utterance contains additional information not present in the MR
	<br>☐ The utterance misses some information from the MR
	<br>☐ The utterance reflects the MR perfectly</p>

<h2><u>Example 2</u></h2>

<p><strong>This is a given Meaning Representation:</strong>
	<br>name[The Eagle], area[city centre], pricerange[cheap]</p>

<p><strong>This is a given utterance that needs to be evaluated:</strong>
	<br>The Eagle are located in the city centre. It is cheap.</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:</p>

<p>The last check-box should be ticked because the utterance contains all the information provided in the meaning representation and nothing additionally:</p>

<p>☐ The utterance contains additional information not present in the MR
	<br>☐ The utterance misses some information from the MR
	<br>☑ The utterance reflects the MR perfectly</p>

<p>This utterance should be scored as of a lower quality (the sentence is not grammatically correct).</p>

<h2><u>Example 3</u></h2>

<p><strong>This is a given Meaning Representation:</strong>
	<br>name[The Eagle], area[city centre], near[Alimentum]</p>

<p><strong>This is a given utterance that needs to be evaluated:</strong>
	<br>The Eagle is located near Alimentum.</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:</p>

<p>The second check-box should be ticked because the utterance does not contain all the information provided in the meaning representation, the concept "<strong>area[city centre]"</strong> is missed:</p>

<p>☐ The utterance contains additional information not present in the MR
	<br>☑ The utterance misses some information from the MR
	<br>☐ The utterance reflects the MR perfectly</p>

<h2><u>Example 4</u></h2>

<p><strong>This is a given Meaning Representation:</strong>
	<br>name[The Eagle], area[city centre]</p>

<p><strong>This is a given utterance that needs to be evaluated:</strong>
	<br>The Eagle is a Chinese restaurant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Answer and explanation</strong>:</p>
