<h1><strong>TASK: Evaluate the informativeness of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the informativeness of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>You will see the Meaning Representation (MR) and automatically generated utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the system should convey.</p>

<p>In this task, you need to evaluate the informativeness of a given utterance. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Informativeness</em></strong> is defined as whether the utterance provides all the information given in the meaning representation and does not give any unnecessary information.</p>

<p>Before evaluating the informativeness, you will see the STANDARD you need to relate your score to. &nbsp;The Informativeness score for the STANDARD is provided.</p>

<p>Your task is to evaluate the utterance shown after the sentence "Here is the TASK for you" for its Informativeness. You may use any whole positive numbers that seem appropriate to you. However, you <strong>may not use negative numbers, zero, fractions or decimals</strong>. Do not worry about running out of numbersâ€”there will always be a larger number than the largest you use (use max 6 digits), and there are a lot of smaller numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please evaluate each utterance in relation to the standard one.</strong> For example, if the current utterance seems of a lower informativeness than the standard one, then assign a score that is lower than the standard informativeness score. If the current utterance seems to be of a higher informativeness than the standard one, then assign a score that is higher than the standard informativeness score.</p>

<p>
	<br>Although the utterance you should evaluate is not grammatically correct and not very fluent, but it contains all the information from the meaning representation and its Informativeness score should be the same as that of the standard.</p>

<p>
	<br>The utterance you should evaluate contains some information that is not provided in the meaning representation - "Chinese restaurant". In addition, it does not contain information covering the concept "<strong>familyFriendly [no]</strong>". &nbsp;Due to this, its informativeness score should be decreased.&nbsp;</p>
