<h1><strong>TASK: Rate the naturalness of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the naturalness of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>In this task, your task is to evaluate each utterance for its naturalness.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Naturalness&nbsp;</em></strong>is defined as whether you think the utterance could have been produced by a native speaker.</p>

<p>Before each task, you will see the STANDARD you need to relate your scores to. &nbsp;You will see the Meaning Representation and automatically generated Utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the utterance should convey. The Informativeness, Naturalness and Quality scores for the STANDARD are provided.</p>

<p>Your task is to evaluate the utterance shown after the sentence "Here is the TASK for you" for its Naturalness. You may use any whole positive numbers that seem appropriate to you. However, you <strong>may not use negative numbers, zero, fractions or decimals</strong>. Do not worry about running out of numbersâ€”there will always be a larger number than the largest you use (use max 6 digits), and there are a lot of smaller numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please evaluate each utterance in relation to the standard one.</strong> For example, if the current utterance seems half as natural as the standard one, then assign a naturalness score that is half of the standard informativeness score. If the current utterance seems to be a lot more natural than the standard one, then assign a naturalness score that is a lot higher than the standard naturalness score.</p>

<h1>Example</h1>
<header style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here is the STANDARD to relate to:</strong></header>

<table style="width: 100%;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 59.1069%;">
				<section>

					<p>Utterance:
						<br><strong>Aromi is located in the city centre. It is not family-friendly.</strong></p>
				</section>
				<br>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 40.7756%;">

				<table style="width: 100%;">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td style="width: 33.3333%; text-align: center;">
								<br>

							<td style="width: 33.3333%; text-align: center;">Naturalness

								<br><strong>100</strong></td>

<header style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here is the TASK for you:</strong></header>

<table style="width: 100%;">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width: 58.8719%;">
				<section>

					<p>Utterance:
						<br><strong>Cocum is in not the centre.</strong></p>
				</section>
			</td>
			<td style="width: 41.0106%;">

				<table style="width: 100%;">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td style="width: 33.3333%; text-align: center;">
								<br>
							</td>
							<td style="width: 33.3333%; text-align: center;">Naturalness
								<br>? (60)
								<br>
							</td>
							<td style="width: 33.3333%; text-align: center;">
								<br>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>
	<br>The utterance you should evaluate does not sound as natural and fluent as the standard, thus its naturalness score should be lower than 100.&nbsp;</p>
