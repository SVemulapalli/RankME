<h1><strong>TASK: Evaluate the informativeness of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the informativeness of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>You will see the Meaning Representation (MR) and automatically generated utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the system should convey.</p>

<p>In this task, you need to evaluate the informativeness of a given utterance.</p>

<p><strong><em>Informativeness</em></strong> is defined as whether the utterance provides all the information given in the meaning representation and does not give any unnecessary information.</p>

<p>Before evaluating the informativeness, you will see the STANDARD you need to relate your score to. &nbsp;The Informativeness score for the STANDARD is provided.</p>

<p>After the sentence "Here is the TASK for you", you will see a Meaning Representation and three potentially different utterances expressing this same meaning. Your task is to <strong>evaluate and rank</strong> the utterances shown after the sentence "Here is the TASK for you" for their Informativeness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may use any whole positive numbers that seem appropriate to you as a score. However, you <strong>may not use negative numbers, zero, fractions or decimals</strong>. Do not worry about running out of numbersâ€”there will always be a larger number than the largest you use (use max 6 digits), and there are a lot of smaller numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please evaluate the Informativeness of each utterance both in relation to the standard one and in relation to each other.</strong> For example, if the first utterance seems twice less informative than the standard one but twice more informative than the second given utterance, then assign an informativeness score for the first utterance that is half of the standard informativeness score. The informativeness score for the second utterance, at the same time, should be twice smaller than the score for the first utterance. If all the given utterances seem to be a bit more informative than the standard one, then assign the same scores to all three utterances and make them a bit higher than the standard informativeness score.</p>

<p>Example</p>
<header style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here is the STANDARD to relate to:</strong></header>

<table style="width: 100%;">

								<br>Informativeness? (90)
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>
	<br><em>Explanation</em>: The first utterance misses some important information (the concept "<strong>area[city centre]"</strong>) from the meaning representation, this is why its Informativeness score is lower comparing to the standard and other utterances.&nbsp;</p>
