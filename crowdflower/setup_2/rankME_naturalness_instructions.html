<h1><strong>TASK: Rate the naturalness of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the naturalness of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>In this task, you need to evaluate each utterance for its naturalness.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Naturalness&nbsp;</em></strong>is defined as whether you think the utterance could have been produced by a native speaker.</p>

<p>Before each task, you will see the STANDARD you need to relate your scores to. &nbsp;You will see the automatically generated Utterance. The Naturalness score for the STANDARD is also provided.</p>

<p>After the sentence "Here is the TASK for you", you will see three potentially different utterances expressing this same meaning. Your task is to <strong>evaluate and rank</strong> the utterances shown after the sentence "Here is the TASK for you" for their Naturalness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may use any whole positive numbers that seem appropriate to you as a score. However, you <strong>may not use negative numbers, zero, fractions or decimals</strong>. Do not worry about running out of numbersâ€”there will always be a larger number than the largest you use (use max 6 digits), and there are a lot of smaller numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please evaluate each utterance both in relation to the standard one and in relation to each other.</strong> For example, if the first utterance seems half as natural as the standard one but twice more natural than the second given utterance, then assign a naturalness score for the first utterance that is half of the standard naturalness score. The naturalness score for the second utterance, at the same time, should be twice smaller than the score for the first utterance. If all the given utterances seem to be a bit more natural than the standard one, then assign the same naturalness scores to all three utterances and make it a bit higher than the standard naturalness score.</p>

								<br>Naturalness? (100)
								<br>

							<td style="width: 33.2156%; text-align: left;">

									<p>

								<br>
								<br>

						</tr>

				</table>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<p>
	<br><em>Explanation</em>: &nbsp;The third utterance sounds a bit less natural than the first two or the standard, thus its Naturalness score is a bit lower.&nbsp;</p>
