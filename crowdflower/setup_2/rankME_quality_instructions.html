<h1><strong>TASK: Evaluate the quality of the given utterance</strong></h1>

<p><strong>The task is to evaluate the quality of the output of the automatic language generation system.&nbsp;</strong>
	<br><strong>Each utterance must be checked and rated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Participants must be native speakers of British or American English.</strong></p>
<hr>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<p>In this experiment, you will evaluate the utterances that a tourist information system might say to someone looking for <strong>information about a place to eat</strong>. The overall goal of this experiment is to improve what the tourist information system says.</p>

<p>You will see the Meaning Representation (MR) and automatically generated utterance. The Meaning Representation is an abstract way of specifying the content which the system should convey.</p>

<p>In this task, you need to (1) evaluate the quality of a given utterance, (2) tick the check-boxes that apply to the utterance. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Quality</em></strong> is defined as an overall quality of the utterance, in terms of its grammatical correctness, fluency and other important factors.</p>

<p>Before evaluating the quality, you will see the STANDARD you need to relate your score to. &nbsp;The Quality score for the STANDARD is provided.</p>

<p>After the sentence "Here is the TASK for you", you will see a Meaning Representation and three potentially different utterances expressing this same meaning. Your task is to <strong>evaluate and rank</strong> the utterances shown after the sentence "Here is the TASK for you" for their Quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may use any whole positive numbers that seem appropriate to you as a score. However, you <strong>may not use negative numbers, zero, fractions or decimals</strong>. Do not worry about running out of numbers—there will always be a larger number than the largest you use (use max 6 digits), and there are a lot of smaller numbers, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please evaluate the Quality of each utterance both in relation to the standard one and in relation to each other.</strong> For example, if the first utterance seems of a twice worse quality than the standard one but of a twice better quality than the second given utterance, then assign a quality score for the first utterance that is half of the standard quality score. The quality score for the second utterance, at the same time, should be twice smaller than the score for the first utterance. If all the given utterances seem to be of a bit higher quality than the standard one, then assign the same quality scores to all three utterances and make them a bit higher than the standard quality score.</p>

<p>Next, you will see check-boxes for each given utterance. The first check-box should be selected if the given utterance contains information that was not mentioned in the given Meaning Representation (MR). The second check-box should be ticked if one or several concepts, that are present in the given Meaning Representation, is not reflected in the utterance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is possible that the utterance both contains additional unnecessary information and omits some information that is present in the MR. In this case, both the first and the second check-box should be ticked.</p>

<p>If the given utterance fully covers the Meaning Representation, does not miss any concepts from the Meaning Representation and does not contain any added information, the last check-box should be selected.</p>

<p>
	<br><em>Explanation</em>: The first utterance has a grammatical error (<em>its</em> instead of <em>is</em>) and misses some important information from the meaning representation, this is why its Quality score is lower comparing to the standard and other utterances. The third utterance sounds less fluent/natural than the standard or the first one, thus its Quality score is lower than the standard. However, it is grammatically correct, so its Quality score is higher than the score for the second utterance.</p>

<p>The first utterance misses the concept "<strong>area[city centre]",</strong> this is why the second check-box is selected. Other utterances fully cover the given meaning representation and do not contain any unnecessary information.</p>
